# CLEF2018
- project: Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks for Hierarchical Species Prediction
  role: Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF 2018)
  duration:            Avignon,France &mdash; Sep,2018 
  #url: "http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2125/paper_184.pdf"
  description: Modelling the  species  distribution  given  their  spatial  environmental  features  along  with the  species  taxonomy , a deep network christened as CLNN,a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), was introduced and tested on the dataset provided by GeoLifeCLEF 2018.

# AAAI2019
- project: DeepTrace &#58; Generic Deep Framework for Cross-Domain Univariate and Multivariate Time Series Forecast (Under Review)
  role: Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-19)
  duration: Hawaii,USA &mdash; Feb,2019
  # url: "#"
  description: A generic framework of model architectures that could work across all classes of time series datasets, named DeepTrace, was introduced to eliminate the feature engineering task without compromising on the accuracy of state-of-the-art models and algorithms.

# SDM2019
- project: A Machine-Learning approach to Occupancy Forecasting using Feature Tuning (Under Review)
  role: SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM19)
  duration: Alberta,Canada &mdash; May,2019
  # url: "#"
  description: Dataset construction, Feature Engineering and Feature Tuning to model crowd behaviour for occupancy forecasting was performed on a historical booking data (2013 - 2017), of a popular Indian multiplex, resulting in significant MAPE & R2 scores.
